## Welcome to BlockLearn Course Page Builder

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Setup

1. Simply fork this repository to your account.
2. Go to your own repository settings, select `master-branch` in GitHub Pages tab.
3. If you want to activate live meeting screen, go to [our meeting link generator](https://blocklearn.github.io/MeetingLinkGenerator/). Choose features you want to use in your meeting, then generate a meeting URL.
4. Copy generated link, and paste it next to `meeting_link: ` variable in your own `_config.yml` file. Then change `course_activated` variable as `course_activated: true`.
5. Your live course page is ready to use at \<username\>.github.io/\<CoursePageBoilerplate\> or \<username\>.github.io/\<YourNewProjectName\>.

If you want to disable live meeting section on your webpage, simply set `course_activated: false` in your `_config.yml` file.

We suggest that you should change the meeting link before every use.
